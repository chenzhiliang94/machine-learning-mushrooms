## The Data
Taken from Kaggle ([See here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification/data)), the data contains more than 8000 different mushrooms species, each having 23 attributes, all relating to the physical observation of a mushroom species. In addition, the data also indicates whether a species of mushroom is either poisonous or edible.

### Features
23 categorical features for each observation in this following format:

### Class
final categorization of a mushroom is binary:
(classes: edible=e, poisonous=p)

## The methodology
Machine learning allows us to use techniques to study a training data set and subsequently predict the class of future data not in the training data set.
In particular for this session, we will use 10%-70% of 8000 mushroom species observations for training, and the rest to test for the prediction accuracy of different machine learning alogrithms.
We will be be using 5 classifier machine learning techniques from the scikit-learn python package:
- Simple Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- K Nearest Neighbours
- Stochastic gradient Descent

In addition, due to the large amount of features for each observation, we be subjecting the data to feature selection. There are 3 kinds of feature selection - filter, wrapper and embedded methods. In the 5 algorithms mentioned above, some already have implicit feature selection steps while others require some preprocessing feature selection.

## The preprocessing - part 1
We first convert all categorical features into dummy variables. [See why we need to do this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/115049/why-do-we-need-to-dummy-code-categorical-variables)
To prevent multicollinearity and high correlation between features, we will have to do further feature selection (See preprocessing part 2 later)

### Simple Decision Tree
Decision trees contain implicit feature selection. In fact, the alogrithm itself focuses on feature selection - it selects a few features which allow us to decide on the final classification of a certain mushroom data.
